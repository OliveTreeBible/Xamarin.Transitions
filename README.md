Declarative & implicit animations Library for Xamarin Forms. 

&nbsp;

## Why Not `Xamarin.Forms.Animation`?
Xamarin Forms provides a common animation API, especially powerful with its `async`/`await` structure and extensibility. For many apps, it may be all that is necessary. **However**, it operates by setting up its own timing and modifying native view propertiies as it goes. This means the platform's hardware acceleration around animations can't be leveraged. Our experience was a sluggish feel that didn't "pop" the way a native app would.

## Example
To automatically animate the opacity of an element, simply add the transition to its attached property. Any property changes will then be animated according to the declaration.

```XML
xmlns:trans="clr-namespace:OliveTree.Transitions;assembly=OliveTree.Transitions"

<Grid x:Name="StatusIndicator">
  <trans:Interaction.Transitions>
    <trans:TransitionCollection>
      <trans:OpacityTransition />
    </trans:TransitionCollection>
  </trans:Interaction.Transitions>

  <Grid.Triggers>
    <DataTrigger Binding="{Binding IsProcessing}" Value="False" TargetType="Grid" >
      <Setter Property="Opacity" Value="0" />
    </DataTrigger>
  </Grid.Triggers>
</Grid>
```

Or triggered in code-behind:
```C#
StatusIndicator.Opacity = 0;
```

## Setup
For the common implementation to resolve platform animations, it must be given an `ITransitionProvider`. Each platform has one built in, but you are welcome to override it should needs arise. Generally, you will initialize it with:
```C#
Forms.Init();
TransitionsLibrary.Register<Provider>();
```
